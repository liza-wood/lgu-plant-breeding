This work groups data into four major categories: Plant intellectual property owned by LGUs: These data are from the USDA PVPO and US PTO via patentR and patentsview packages that wrap around the Patents View API, filtered to match Land Grant University names. LGU plant variety licensing agreements: These data were requested from all 50 1862 LGUs. The focus was on licensing agreements made between 2000-2020, with data on what plant variety was licensed, to whom, and with what restrictions. Licensee profiles: The license data collected from Part 2 were used to create an index of licensees. Licensees were searched in the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Hoovers database, which includes company profile data, to identify the location, size (sales and employees), and co-ownership structure of the licensees. LGU awards. These data were requested from 25 LGUs (respondents to licensing request) for the time span 2000-2020. The focus was on awards data to the university’s closest thing to a College of Agriculture, which would likely include breeders as well as a host of other researchers. The analysis for these data are ongoing, and what follows are preliminary descriptive summaries of the data we have collected and cleaned. Note: There are still several errors and the data presented is still not entirely clean, so please excuse any errors and take results as preliminary.

A summary of plant variety innovation at LGU Agricultural Colleges, 1973-2020 Authors: Liza Wood, Adam Vera, Victoria Fletcher Date: 2023-09-27 1.1 Introduction Plant breeding has long been an important role of public research, particularly at US Land Grant Universities (LGUs), to support the agricultural development and meet the (pre-competitive) needs of growers in the state. This page summarizes plant breeding activities at LGUs for as far back as Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and Plant Variety Protection (PVP) records are electronically available, from 1973 to 2020. We identify the types of crops that universities are developing and protecting through these methods, and how the number of varieties being registered differs across LGU states and over time. Results regarding the qualities of the crops that universities are developing/protecting are forthcoming. Data for these summaries are drawn from the the USPTO and PVP databases, refined to include only protections from the 50 1862 LGUs. We find a total of 2501 plant varieties that have been protected by plant patents and PVPs between 1973-2020. To gather these data, we looked at PVP applications with Universities as Applicants. For USPTO, this meant looking for Plant Patents and Utility Patents with plant names where LGUs were Assignees, as well as Agricultural Research Centers and State applications that were observed in the licensing agreements. Key take-aways are as follows: LGUs are most active in breeding cereals, ornamental, and fruits and nuts above other crop types (e.g. legumes, roots, vegetables) Certain states are more active than others in their breeding and protecting of plant intellectual property: California, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas have the most prolific breeding programs There has been a steady increase in overall development and protection of plant varieties through both PVP and PTO protections 1.2 What plant material have LGUs been developing? The plant varieties developed by LGUs were categorized into one of ten groupings designated by the FAO Agricultural Census, in line with research by Pardey et al. 2013. By and large, cereals are the largest crop category being developed at LGUs, accounting for 31% of all varieties, followed by ornamental plants, fruits and nuts, and oilseeds. A summary of the crop groupings are as follows: 1.3 How does plant variety development vary across the US? We can further subdivide the data based on state to identify different geographic hot spots of variety development/protection. We omit ornamental crops from this and future analyses to zero in on agricultural plant variety development. We find that the most active LGUs (top 10) for crop variety development are: California, Georgia, New Jersey, Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, Minnesota, Louisiana, Idaho, Michigan. The range of crops protected from these top-10 state institutions ranges from 182 in California to 78 in Michigan, over the last 40+ years. LGUs from eight states were not identified: Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wyoming … (is this a mistake of ours in how these states might name their LGU?). 1.4 How have LGUs been protecting their plant material? LGUs have been protecting their plant material with both Plant and Utility Patents from the PTO and through PVPs, with slight preference for PVPs. Between 1973-2020 2501 applications have been submitted by LGUs, 1822 as PVP and 865 via the USPTO (794 as plant patents and 71 as utility patents). There have a steady increase in both IP types over time, where the total number of patents over the decades increased from 215 between 1981-1990, to 318 between 1991-2000, 614 between 2001-2010, and 694 between 2011-2020. Within these total increases, the proportion of protection types has slightly shifted, where the proportion of varieties being protected by the PTO, rather than via PVPs, has gone from 0.33 between 1981-1990, to 0.2 between 1991-2000, 0.25 between 2001-2010, and 0.36 between 2011-2020. 1.5 Forthcoming: What qualities do these plants have? Of the 2501 plant varieties that have been protected by PVPs or patents, we qualitatively coded a random subset of the plant descriptions (10%, 250). Coding resulted in the identification of nine preliminary themes: physical/phenological traits (size, color, texture, flavor, scent), disease resistance, climate tolerance, seasonality, and non-traditional environments (e.g. marginal lands, organic). We used these 250 manual classifications to train a neural network to classify plant description text into these categories. 1.6 Notes We also want to capture varieties not protected by traditional means. To do this, we have also have scraped the OSSI website to create a database of seeds pledged that way, and intend to scrape the USDA GRIN site to identify accession submitted on behalf of universities.

A summary of research funding for LGU Agricultural Colleges, 2012-2020 Authors: Liza Wood, Victoria Fletcher, Adam Vera Date: 2023-09-27 2.1 Introduction The research carried out by universities is largely a product of grant funding. What breeders propose, and whether they are able to carry out that research, depends on the resources to do so. This report analyzes the grant funding to Principle Investigators (PIs) at Land Grant Universities (LGUs), particularly those that engage in plant breeding research. This analysis explores how much money is coming in to LGUs and from whom. We base this report on data collected via public records requests. The records requested include all grant funding to LGU’s agricultural colleges between 2000-2020, though some universities were only able to report the last 10 years, starting from 2012. These data were requested for the 25 LGUs in our licensing data (Section 3), however, we have not received responses from all of them. Furthermore, for the responses we do have, the data are not all clean. Thus this analysis presents a pilot for 6 states: California, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana. Key take-aways are as follows: Agricultural colleges at LGUs in California, Michigan, and Minnesota are among the most highly funded, both in absolute and per-project terms Funding to agricultural colleges and breeding programs comes largely from federal money, though agricultural commodity groups are also prominent funders Breeding projects account for only about 1-5% of funded projects in LGU agricultural colleges; details on funders are provided in tables below 2.2 How much grant money goes to LGU agricultural colleges? First we summarize the overall funding to the agricultural colleges in each LGU between 2012-2020. California, Michigan, and Minnesota receive the highest award values for agricultural research, totaling over $1 billion, $692 million, and $545 million over the 9 years, respectively. On the lower side of the spectrum, Montana, Idaho, and Louisiana receive only $198 million, $110 million, and $4 million over the same time period. Some of these differences are a feature of size. Of the PIs granted awards over this time period, there are 616 from California, 462 from Michigan, 390 from Minnesota, 206 from Montana, 207 from Idaho, and only 38 from Louisiana. Likewise, the number of funded projects is 5063 from California, 2343 from Michigan, 2683 from Minnesota, 1582 from Montana, 1899 from Idaho, and only 74 from Louisiana. We account for size by calculating the average award amount per project (figure below), but the general impression is about the same. Michigan averages $295K per project, California $203K, and Minnesota $196K. Montana averages $125K per project, Idaho $57K and Louisiana $50K. 2.3 Who is funding LGU agricultural colleges? As for who is funding agricultural research, this question is still under investigation. While all universities list the sponsoring organization, only California aggregated these sponsors into higher-level groupings (e.g. federal government, business, charity). Our research group will be making sponsor names uniform and binning them throughout the research process, and below we provide a summary of the aggregate contributions to research at UC Davis. Table 2.1: California funding amount from sponsor groups, 2012-2020 Sponsor type Awards total ($M) Percent of total funding (%) Federal 1035.8 45 State 482.3 21 Agricultural marketing organization 133.6 6 Other university/research institute 129.3 6 Business 111.8 5 Charity 101.5 4 Interest group 82.5 4 UC internal &amp; Office of the President 80.6 4 Foundation 69.5 3 Other government 50.8 2 Other university/research institute 12.6 1 Unassigned 0.6 0 2.4 How much grant money goes to plant breeding? Beyond funding for agricultural colleges, we are particularly interested in the funding that goes to plant breeding. With the data we’ve been given, it is challenging to isolate plant breeding funding without a complete list of all plant breeders from each university. To overcome this challenge we can take two approaches: 1) using key words in research project titles and 2) using names of breeders from plant variety &amp; licensing data. 2.4.1 Identify plant breeding through project name First, we use funded project titles based on detection of relevant plant breeding words to identify some of the projects related to plant breeding. We look for titles that include words like “breed”, “seed”, “germplasm”, and “variety”, but not terms related to animal breeding, seed treatments, or seeding rates. This approach will likely miss several projects that do not have plant-breeding specific titles, however, it provides a cursory look at plant breeding projects. This approach identifies 268 projects across the six universities in our pilot. Some titles include: Spring wheat breeding and genetics Fusarium yellows in celery: breeding and maintaining resistance, and integrated control. Increasing the rate of genetic gain for yield in soybean breeding programs Based on this approach, we calculate that breeding projects account for 1% of all agricultural college projects and 1% of all agricultural college funding dollars. Of these projects, the dominant sponsors for each state are listed below, along with their total award value (in thousand USD) between 2012-2020. Currently, sponsor names have not been made uniform so we see sources like NIFA listed under slightly different names for each state. Here we see again that federal funders and USDA are among the largest contributors, but agricultural commodity groups and interest groups are also prominent. 2.4.2 Identify plant breeders through PI name A second approach is to start with our data on plant varieties and licenses (Section 3) and pull out the plant breeders linked to those licenses. So far this is an imperfect process, as not all varieties are linked explicitly to a breeder (this is an ongoing data collection process). Preliminarily, for the six universities in our pilot analysis, we identify 165 plant breeders, with the following counts per university: Table 2.2: Number of breeders per state from variety and licensing data, 2000-2020 State Count of inventors California 32 Idaho 10 Louisiana 33 Michigan 29 Minnesota 49 Montana 12 We can search for those names in the list of PIs in our awards data to see how many of those 165 plant breeders we have funding data for. Using this method we identify funding for 54 of the 165 on our inventor list. This may be due to a mismatch in time scales for which we requested funding data, as we’d except that all LGU breeders have received some funding for the their research. Of the breeders we did identify in the funding data, those breeders are associated with 1290 projects. Some titles from this approach include: Cultivar Development Commercialization of Spring and Winter Triticale for Forage and Feed Development of Multipurpose Potato Cultivars with Enhanced Quality, Disease and Pest Resistance ¿ North Central Region 201921 Sugarbeet Production Research to Improve the Yield and Quality of Sugarbeets Based on this approach, we calculate that breeding projects account for 5% of all agricultural college projects and 5% of all agricultural college funding dollars. Of these projects, the dominant sponsors for each state are listed below, along with their total award value (in thousand USD) between 2012-2020.

A summary of plant material licensing for LGU Agricultural Colleges, 2000-2020 Authors: Adam Vera, Liza Wood, Victoria Fletcher Date: 2023-09-27 3.1 Introduction US Land Grant Universities (LGUs) are an important contributor to public plant breeding. Universities develop different plant material and varieties and then (increasingly) license the plant material they develop to third parties to commercialize and/or continue to innovation. This report summarizes plant variety licenses between LGUs and the companies that purchase these products. This analysis explores the role specific universities have in this market, the breakdown of crops licensed by university, and the financial profile of the companies that purchase the licenses from LGUs. We base this report on data collected via public records requests. These records include licensing agreement data (what material is being licensed and to whom) between 2000-2020 for 25 LGUs (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wyoming. We requested data from all 50 states, but only received data from half due to public records requests denials or prohibitive costs. Key take-aways are as follows: 7480 licensing agreements across 25 Land Grant Universities between 2000-2020 Agreements are with 1161 companies and 141 other entities (organizations, universities, individuals, etc.) 1918 unique plant varieties and/or breeding lines are licensed 3.2 What crops are being licensed? We categorize the crops LGUs are developing into one of 10 groupings designated by the FAO Agricultural Census, and we can summarize these crop types across different universities in our data. Note that we remove ornamental plants from this analysis to focus in only on food and cash crops. The crops most often licensed resemble the general trend of what we see in LGU plant variety development protection: cereals, fruits and nuts, and oilseeds. The crop licensed the most of all crop categories is cereals, making up 46% of licenses. The next most popular categories are fruits and nuts (17%) and oilseeds (16%). Cereals in our licensing data are comprised of primarily wheat (73%), with barley a far second (18%), the remaining nine crops in the cereal category leaving a long tail (e.g. sorghum, oat, corn, rice, millet, teff). Crop category Count of licenses Percent of all licenses Cereals 3232 46% Fruits &amp; nuts 1223 17% Oilseeds 1112 16% Vegetables &amp; melons 753 11% Roots &amp; tubers 422 6% Non-food (cotton &amp; tabacco) 145 2% Grasses &amp; fodder 64 1% Leguminous 44 1% Sugar, spice &amp; medicinal 28 0% Washington dominates the cereal licensing at 2122 licenses, licensing 65.6% (2122/3234) of cereals. The next largest producer of cereals is Oregon, at 15% (485/3234). In the table below, we calculate the count and percentage of crops in all of the states in our sample. 3.3 How has licensing changed over time? We look at the date of the licensing agreements to understand trends in university licensing over time. Across the 25 universities, licensing has been steadily increasing, which aligns with the trends of plant variety innovation generally (Section 1). The amount of licensing varies by state considerably. The number of licenses over the twenty year periods= ranges from only 1 in Arizona to 2378 in Washington, with an annual average of 22 licenses. To evaluate this variation across states, we group licenses into five-year time periods to present changes in licensing trends across different universities. Given our limited ability to observe trends across all 25 universities at once, we also choose to identify and highlight only the top five universities by license count (Washington, Oregon, North Carolina, Texas, Iowa), while the remaining twenty universities are considered to be “Other”. This is represented in a plot below per five year time period. 3.4 Who is licensing LGU plant material? Our team has used the licensing records to build out a data base of companies and organizations who have licensed material from LGUs. We have relied on the D&amp;B Hoovers data base for most of this company data, including information such as the location of company headquarters and their size, as measured by sales (2022) and total number of employees across their locations. LGU plant material has been licensed to 1161 companies and 141 public, non-profit, or individual licensees. The most active licensees are listed in the table below, all of whom have purchased over 30 licenses in the last 20 years. 3.5 What do we know about company licensees? The companies licensing LGU plant varieties are primarily located in the United States with few international companies. The table below shows company headquarters’ location by country, where 83.8% (973/1161) of companies are domestic. Using the data from D&amp;D Hoovers, we identified the the total sales per company as an estimate of company size. This sales value was calculated as the highest sales number per company level in order to capture company’s size at the highest scale, rather than just one branch or region. These sales data can be used to categorize companies into categories: small and large. The U.S. Small Business Administration determines what is a small business based on its industry. The average annual sales for the farming industry to be considered a small business is less than 3 million dollars. (Note: Of the 263 companies (23%) that we could not identify in the D&amp;B database, we assume that they are small because D&amp;B preferences larger companies in its database). With this $3 million division between small and large businesses, we find that 868 companies fall into the small category, where average small company makes $685K dollars annually (2022 data). On the other hand, 293 companies fall into the large category, where average large company makes $6.6B dollars annually. 3.5.1 Do certain LGUs trend towards small or large company clients? On average, universities seem to license slightly more to smaller companies, with large companies accounting for about a third of licenses. We evaluate the relationship between plant variety licenses and the types of companies that purchase those licenses. Of the 6,966 licenses that we can connect to companies, 35% are to large companies. The percentage of small versus large companies that are licensees per university is quite similar across all states. For example, 29% of Washington’s licenses are to large companies, though this number slightly increases: 34% of Texas’s, 36% of Oregon’s, 37% or North Carolina’s, 38% of Iowa’s and 43% of Other university’s licenses are to large companies. DRAFT: Add in the percent of all companies that are large to identify if their licenzing activity is proportional to the number of companies. The result is large companies account for about 25% of companies but 30-40% of licenses, so they are slightly more active. 3.5.2 Do certain crop categories trend towards small or large company clients? There does not appear to be a clear trend whereby large companies are licensing specific types of crops. Large companies account for 42% of oilseed licenses, between 31-36% of vegetable, fruit and nut, and cereal licenses, though only 11% of roots and tubers. 3.6 DRAFT: Variety licensing networks The figures below display, by crop category, what operations are licensing material the most from LGUs. Circles are sized based on the number of license agreements made, and colored by the region in which the operation is based: West in dark purple, Northeast in dark blue, South in aqua, North Central in green, any companies outside of the US are in yellow, and non-companies in grey.
