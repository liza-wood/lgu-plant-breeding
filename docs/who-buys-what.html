<p>US Land Grant Universities (LGUs) are an important contributor to public plant breeding. Universities develop different plant material and varieties and then (increasingly) <em>license</em> the plant material they develop to third parties to commercialize and/or continue to innovation. This report summarizes plant variety licenses between LGUs and the companies that purchase these products. This analysis explores the role specific universities have in this market, the breakdown of crops licensed by university, and the financial profile of the companies that purchase the licenses from LGUs.</p>
<p>We base this report on data collected via public records requests. These records include licensing agreement data (what material is being licensed and to whom) between 2000-2020 for 25 LGUs (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wyoming. We requested data from all 50 states, but only received data from half due to public records requests denials or prohibitive costs.</p>
<p>Key take-aways are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>7480 licensing agreements across 25 Land Grant Universities between 2000-2020<br />
</li>
<li>Agreements are with 1161 companies and 141 other entities (organizations, universities, individuals, etc.)<br />
</li>
<li>1918 unique plant varieties and/or breeding lines are licensed</li>

  1) X: Row Number
  2) crop_name_common: common name of each crop
  3) crop_name_scientific: scientific name of each crop with genus and species
  4) variety_name: name of specific variety given by the inventor
  5) licensee: buyer of license

  7) effective_date: date of purchase/license
  8) end_date: termination date of license agreement
  9) uni_state: state of university
  10) ip_name: intellectual property crop name
  11) fao_class1: general classification of crop given by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)
  12) fao_class2: more specific classification of crop given by FAO
  13) ornamental: marks whether the crop is an ornamental (TRUE) or not (FALSE)
  14) orn_use: type of ornamental for such crops that are TRUE
  15) crop_cat: same as fao_class1 with proper formatting

<!--- 2. Next we want to make some summaries of the licensing data (again, these may be similar to what we practiced last term). Take a look at the columns we have and think about what you'd like to know about the data. For instance: 
  * How many different licenses do we have...
    * Per year? --->
<p>We categorize the crops LGUs are developing into one of 10 groupings designated by the <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/a0135e/A0135E10.htm#app3">FAO Agricultural Census</a>, and we can summarize these crop types across different universities in our data. Note that we remove ornamental plants from this analysis to focus in only on food and cash crops.</p>
<p>The crops most often licensed resemble the general trend of what we see in LGU plant variety development protection: cereals, fruits and nuts, and oilseeds. The crop licensed the most of all crop categories is cereals, making up 46% of licenses. The next most popular categories are fruits and nuts (17%) and oilseeds (16%). Cereals in our licensing data are comprised of primarily wheat (73%), with barley a far second (18%), the remaining nine crops in the cereal category leaving a long tail (e.g. sorghum, oat, corn, rice, millet, teff).</p>
<!----NAs values for FAO class mostly resemble ornamental crops and have been removed. This report is more focused on food and cash crops. -- worth realizing that NAs in the fao_class1 variable become ornamental in the crop_cat variable if ornamental varible = T--->

<p>We look at the date of the licensing agreements to understand trends in university licensing over time. Across the 25 universities, licensing has been steadily increasing, which aligns with the trends of plant variety innovation generally (Section 1).</p>
<p><img src="03_licensing-overview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The amount of licensing varies by state considerably. The number of licenses over the twenty year periods= ranges from only 1 in Arizona to 2378 in Washington, with an annual average of 22 licenses.</p>
<!--- To accurately represent this, manipulations of the data frame is required to determine the effective year of the license as well as group licenses into five year periods.--->
<p>To evaluate this variation across states, we group licenses into five-year time periods to present changes in licensing trends across different universities. Given our limited ability to observe trends across all 25 universities at once, we also choose to identify and highlight only the top five universities by license count (Washington, Oregon, North Carolina, Texas, Iowa), while the remaining twenty universities are considered to be “Other”. This is represented in a plot below per five year time period.</p>

  Two data frames are joined for this report: Companies and Licenses. Licenses describe the agreement between universities and companies, while the Companies include information regarding the companies themselves. The unique number of licensees in the licenses data frame is larger than the number of companies in the companies data frame. This suggests that not all licensees are documented by the companies database used in this report. This is because some licensees are listed as individuals and various associations that are not considered to be companies.
--->
<p>Our team has used the licensing records to build out a data base of companies and organizations who have licensed material from LGUs. We have relied on the D&amp;B Hoovers data base for most of this company data, including information such as the location of company headquarters and their size, as measured by sales (2022) and total number of employees across their locations.</p>
<p>LGU plant material has been licensed to 1161 companies and 141 public, non-profit, or individual licensees. The most active licensees are listed in the table below, all of whom have purchased over 30 licenses in the last 20 years.</p>
<!--- * Compare this number to the number of _unique_ companies in the licensing data (Hint: you need to reduce the number of rows in the licensing data so that you only have unique licensee 'names' or the type == company). --->

<p>The companies licensing LGU plant varieties are primarily located in the United States with few international companies. The table below shows company headquarters’ location by country, where 83.8% (973/1161) of companies are domestic.</p>

<!--- * How 'big' are the companies? E.g. What is the range of sales data across all of the companies? What is the average sales number across all of the companies? --->
<p>Using the data from D&amp;D Hoovers, we identified the the total sales per company as an estimate of company size. This sales value was calculated as the highest sales number per company level in order to capture company’s size at the highest scale, rather than just one branch or region. These sales data can be used to categorize companies into categories: small and large. The U.S. Small Business Administration determines what is a small business based on its industry. The average annual sales for the farming industry to be considered a small business is less than 3 million dollars. (Note: Of the 263 companies (23%) that we could not identify in the D&amp;B database, we assume that they are small because D&amp;B preferences larger companies in its database).</p>
<p>With this $3 million division between small and large businesses, we find that 868 companies fall into the small category, where average small company makes $685K dollars annually (2022 data). On the other hand, 293 companies fall into the large category, where average large company makes $6.6B dollars annually.</p>
<!--- The two data frames can be joined by the licensee column. With size ranges, licenses can be categorized by university, licensee size, and FAO class. NA values of license size and FAO class are removed in order to accurately represent university action. --->

<p>On average, universities seem to license slightly more to smaller companies, with large companies accounting for about a third of licenses. We evaluate the relationship between plant variety licenses and the types of companies that purchase those licenses. Of the 6,966 licenses that we can connect to companies, 35% are to large companies. The percentage of small versus large companies that are licensees per university is quite similar across all states. For example, 29% of Washington’s licenses are to large companies, though this number slightly increases: 34% of Texas’s, 36% of Oregon’s, 37% or North Carolina’s, 38% of Iowa’s and 43% of Other university’s licenses are to large companies.</p>
<p>DRAFT: Add in the percent of all companies that are large to identify if their licenzing activity is proportional to the number of companies. The result is large companies account for about 25% of companies but 30-40% of licenses, so they are slightly more active.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be a clear trend whereby large companies are licensing specific types of crops. Large companies account for 42% of oilseed licenses, between 31-36% of vegetable, fruit and nut, and cereal licenses, though only 11% of roots and tubers.</p>

<!--- ex) WRONG Washington works with 62% (1470/2378) small companies. 88% (1278/1470) of those small companies are interested in cereals. This is not significantly different than what Washington's normal cereals production at 89% (2122/2378).

## Case study: University of California, Davis  
<!--- * Do a bit of exploring for UC Davis only (Hint: filter for just California). Within UC Davis, revisit the questions above to create a bit of a licensing 'profile' for UC Davis (essentially, tell a story about UC Davis licensing) 
  
University of California, Davis is the home institution of our research team, and is also among the top-10 active universities in our data with 210 licenses. Therefore, we take particular interest in California as a case study. Below, we see that California primarily produces fruits and nuts, and we note that all licenses are sold via exclusive licenses.

Within California, we evaluated what companies they were licensing material to, particularly their size and if those companies were within the state of California. We find that UC Davis is mainly licensing to international companies, which is exceptional among LGUs, but that those international companies were normally small. Of the domestic companies they work with, very few are in the state of California, and nearly all of them are large (annual sales >\$3B).
